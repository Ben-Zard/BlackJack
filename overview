A card is dealt to the player facing upwards (visible to everyone).
The dealer deals a card to himself visible to everyone.
Another card is given to the player facing upwards.
The dealer deals a card facing downwards for himself.
The player has to decide whether to stand with the current set of cards or get another card.
If the player decides to hit, another card is dealt.
If the player decides to stand, then the dealer reveals his hidden card.
The dealer does not have the authority to decide whether to hit or stand. The general rule is that the dealer needs to keep hitting more cards if the sum of dealer’s cards is less than 17.
As soon as the sum of dealer’s cards is either 17 or more, the dealer is obliged to stand.
According to the final sum of the cards, the winner is decided.

To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:

Create a deck of 52 cards
Shuffle the deck
Ask the Player for their bet
Make sure that the Player's bet does not exceed their available chips
Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player
Show only one of the Dealer's cards, the other remains hidden
Show both of the Player's cards
Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card
If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
Determine the winner and adjust the Player's chips accordingly
Ask the Player if they'd like to play again
